The Mighty Lemon Drops

When the shaking starts
And the sky falls down
When the beating heart is the only sound
Round and round turn me upside down

The river runs deep and wide
Take me to the other side
I manage just before the ride
Take me to the other side
C'mon on baby

Sink so low
Down in 64
When the Holy Joe
Are banging on your door
Twist and shout turn me inside out

The river runs deep and wide
Take me to the other side
I'm in it just for the ride
Take me to the other side
C'mon on baby

Bridge

Would you like to see the other side of me?
I can see right through the other side of you.

When the shaking starts
And the sky falls downs
When the beating heart
Is the only sound
Round and round turn me upside down

The river runs deep and wide
Take me to the other side
I'm in it just for the ride
Take me to the other side
C'mon on baby, C'mon baby, C'mon baby
