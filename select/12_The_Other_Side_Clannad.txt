When it's gone and you want it so badly
A game of love is a two way street
And from above there comes inspiration
Darkest clouds will disappear

CHORUS
Take it down, put it in your diary
Come around to the pleasant side
Put it down to another experience
Come around to the other side

Fallen words from a broken framework
Touching hearts scribbled on a sheet
And from above here comes inspiration
Darkest clouds will disappear

CHORUS
CHORUS

When it hurts and the pain still lingers
A game of love now a one way street
Faith and hope is your only connection
Darkest clouds may disappear

CHORUS
CHORUS
CHORUS
