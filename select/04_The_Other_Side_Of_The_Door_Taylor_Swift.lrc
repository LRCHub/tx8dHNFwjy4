[00:12.06] In the heat of the fight, I walked away
[00:18.12] Ignoring words that you were saying trying to make me stay
[00:23.55] I said "this time I've had enough"
[00:29.93] And you've called a hundred times but I'm not pickin' up
[00:36.52] 'Cause I'm so mad, I might tell you that it's over
[00:42.64] But if you look a little closer
[00:58.14] 
[00:47.60] I said "leave", but all I really want is you
[00:53.30] To stand outside my window, throwing pebbles, screaming "I'm in love with you"
[00:59.61] Wait there in the pourin' rain, come back for more!
[01:05.22] And don't you leave 'cause I know all I need is on
[01:09.63] The other side of the door
[01:22.63] 
[01:22.19] Me and my stupid pride sittin' here alone
[01:28.78] Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
[01:33.77] I keep going back over the things we both said
[01:40.05] And I remember the slammin' door and all the things that I misread
[01:46.50] So, babe, if you know everything tell me why you couldn't see
[01:52.53] That when I left I wanted you to chase after me?
[02:16.53] 
[01:58.04] I said leave but all I really want is you
[02:03.76] To stand outside my window, throwing pebbles, screaming I'm in love with you
[02:09.89] Wait there in the pourin' rain, come back for more
[02:15.58] And don't you leave 'cause I know all I need is on
[02:19.80] The other side of the door
[02:32.80] 
[02:33.19] And I scream out the window
[02:36.36] "I can't even look at you, I don't need you"
[02:41.04] But I do, I do, I do...
[02:45.69] I said "there's nothing you can't say
[02:48.69] To make this right again"
[02:50.73] I mean it, I mean it, what I mean is
[03:08.73] 
[03:02.50] I said "leave" but, baby, all I want is you
[03:08.16] To stand outside my window, throwing pebbles, screaming "I'm in love with you"
[03:14.29] Wait there in the pourin' rain, come back for more!
[03:20.07] And don't you leave 'cause I know all I need is on
[03:24.39] The other side of the door
[03:37.39] 
[03:26.54] With your face and your beautiful eyes
[03:28.60] And the conversation with the little white lies
[03:31.51] And the faded picture of a beautiful night
[03:34.69] You carry me from your car up the stairs
[03:37.41] And I broke down cryin', was it worth this mess?
[03:40.22] After everything and that little black dress
[03:43.20] After everything, I must confess I need you
