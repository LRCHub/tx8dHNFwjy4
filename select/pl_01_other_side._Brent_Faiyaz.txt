Is you for me?
First thing in the mornin'
or late at night
I move and breathe
(Ha)
To make sure you feel
special being mine
(Oh, mine)
If you really love it here
(Love it, baby)
Then,
won't you tell me all the
time?
(All the time, ooh)
Girl, you know I love it here
(I love the life)
you're the only thing I like
(Oh-oh)
(Girl, you)
You must be from the other
side
(Other side)
'Cause I saw you in my
dreams last night
(You were in my dreams)
You must be from the other side
(Girl, I saw you)
'Cause I saw you in my
dreams last night
Wish that I could hold your hand
You would never have to
feel alone, mm
The perks to come when I'm
your man
You don't have to deal
with nothing on your own
world girl
(Ooh)
If you really love it here
(Love it, baby)
Then,
won't you tell me all the
time?
(All the time, ooh)
Girl, you know I love it here,
you're the only thing I like
(Girl, you)
You must be from the other
side
(Other side)
'Cause I saw you in my
dreams last night
You must be from the other side
(Girl, I saw you)
'Cause I saw you in my
dreams last night
The other night I saw you
(Other night I saw you)
If I told you where,
you wouldn't believe me
(Told you where,
you wouldn't believe)
The other night I saw you
(Other night I saw you)
You were always there in
my dreams
The other night I saw you
(Other night I saw you)
If I told you where,
you wouldn't believe me
(Told you where,
you wouldn't believe)
The other night I saw you
(Other night I saw
you; ooh-ooh-ooh)
You were always there in
my dreams
(I saw you, girl)
If you really love it here
(Love it, baby)
Then won't you tell me all
the time?
(All the time, ooh)
Girl, you know I love it here,
you're the only thing I like
(Girl, you)
You must be from the other
side
(Other side)
'Cause I saw you in my
dreams last night
You must be from the other side
(Girl, I saw you)
'Cause I saw you in my
dreams last night
You must be from the other side
